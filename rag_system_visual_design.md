# Multi-Agent RAG System Visual Design Scheme

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

A precise, structural, and sophisticated visual identity that mirrors the intelligence of the RAG system. The aesthetic draws inspiration from the functional clarity of Dieter Rams and the systematic approach of the Swiss International Style. The core idea is to create a visual framework that embodies organization and precision, using a strong grid system and restrained typography to make complex technical information accessible and authoritative.

### Content Density

High Density: The content is a detailed technical specification, prioritizing comprehensive information delivery for a technical audience. Each slide should efficiently present 3-5 key points, diagrams, or code snippets, with a content-to-whitespace ratio of approximately 80/20 to maximize knowledge transfer.

## 2. Color System

**Primary Colors**

- Background color: #1A202C (Deep charcoal blue - creates a sophisticated, technical atmosphere)
- Primary color: #4A5568 (Cool gray - for main structural elements)
- Secondary color: #A0AEC0 (Light gray-blue - for supporting information)
- Accent color: #4FD1C5 (Teal cyan - for highlighting critical technical components)

**Text Colors**

- Dark text (for light backgrounds): #1A202C
- Light text (for dark backgrounds): #E2E8F0

## 3. Font Design

**Heading Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Chiron Hei HK (A modern geometric sans with sharp lines, conveying a strong sense of technology and precision - used for main titles and section headers)
  - Hedvig Letters Sans (A distinctive sans-serif with an engineered feel, adding a unique brand character - used for chapter titles and emphasis)

**Body Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Quattrocento Sans (A classic and highly readable sans-serif, ensuring clarity for dense technical data - primary body text)
  - Coda (A rounded and open sans-serif, offering a slightly more approachable tone - used for captions and notes)

## 4. Image Style

Imagery should be strictly functional and informational. Prioritize clean, minimalist diagrams, flowcharts, and architectural schematics using the defined color palette. Icons and graphics should be monochrome or duotone, adhering to a consistent line weight and style. Avoid photographic imagery in favor of abstract geometric patterns or data visualizations that directly support the technical content.
